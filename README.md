# First steps

At the beginning of my intoduction into GitHub I create a plan and will write an abstract, where I will note all importent things.
Today is 3.August.2021. I created repository named Starting_with_Git and wrote a README file here.

Today is 26.September 2021. I think how to understand how GITHUB works, but it's to complicated...

Today is 29th January 2023, I study 3rd year Bc degree, remains only one semestr of hardwork. After exams I hope I will have more time for my hobbies. This semester I will have 11 subjects and it'll be really hard and I will have no time to rest. I think it is a good idea to get together programming in Python and study mathematics and signal processing, may be it makes my CV more attractive.
